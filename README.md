React.js basics

This very simple repository will allow you to understand the basics of React.js.


Here we will see in particular:

- The creation of our first component : CustomerList 
  + use of a separate component
  + map on an array
  + use of local state

- Events  
  + button onClick 

- Modify the state and see the component react  
  + The use of this.setState() on a counter
  + .slice & .findIndex 
  + Form: adding and deleting

- Refactoring
  + spread operator
  + division / separation of components
  + props / communication between components
